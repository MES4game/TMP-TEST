## Usage

Next steps define how to download the project and run it under a port/path, you will have to configure a webserver on your machine to access it from internet (using nginx, apache2, etc.).

- ### Node.JS
  - need to clone the repository
  - need to have npm
  1. open a terminal at the root of the cloned repository
  2. run `npm ci`
  3. for development: run `npm run dev:run -- --port=<number>` and replace `<port>` with the port you want
  4. for production: run `npm run build:run -- --output-path=<path>` and replace `<path>` with the path of the folder you want (it needs to be created before)

- ### Docker
  - NO need to clone the repository
  - image: [![Docker Image Version](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/ciapops/site-bde-front?sort=semver) ![Docker Image Size](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/ciapops/site-bde-front?sort=semver)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ciapops/site-bde-front)
  - docker-compose:
    1. open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to download the `docker-compose.yml` file
    2. you can find an example of `docker-compose.yml` in the [`docker config`](./.docker/front) folder
      - you can copy it with `curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CIA-PolytechPS/DEV-SITE-BDE-FRONT/main/.docker/front/docker-compose.yml`
    3. you also need to copy [`example.env`](./.docker/front/example.env) to `.env`
      - you can get it with `curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CIA-PolytechPS/DEV-SITE-BDE-FRONT/main/.docker/front/example.env`
    4. edit `.env` to your needs
    5. run `docker-compose up -d --force-recreate --pull always` to start the container

## Git conventions

- ### Branches:
  - `main`: production branch
  - `dev`: development branch (all features must be merged here first)
  - `<service>`: service branches (must be created from `dev` and merged back to `dev`)
  - `<service>-<id>`: task branches (must be created from `<service>` and merged back to `<service>`)

- ### Commits:
  - `<type>(<scope>): <comment>`
    - `<type>`: type of the commit (must be one of the following, can be combined with `|`):
      - `feat`: new feature
      - `fix`: bug fix
      - `docs`: documentation only changes
      - `style`: changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
      - `refactor`: code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
      - `perf`: code change that improves performance
      - `test`: adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
      - `chore`: changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
      - `merge`: merges branches
    - `<scope>`: name of the branch (`service-id`)
    - `<comment>`: short description of the commit
  - example: `feat(user-42): add login feature`
  - example: `feat|perf|style(home-21): add last event feature, improve performance for render and fix styles of first section`
  - every commit must be signed with a GPG/SSH key (set it up with `./setup.sh`)
  - make reasonable sized commits (do not commit everything in one commit, but do not make too many small commits either)
  - write meaningful commit messages (do not use `fix` or `update` as comment, be more specific)

- ### PR:
  - title: `merge(<source>-><target>): <comment>`
    - `<source>`: source branch
    - `<target>`: target branch
    - `<comment>`: short description of the PR
  - description
    - follow the template provided by GitHub
  - reviewers: at least one reviewer must be assigned (preferably the repository admin or the service manager)
  - In case of a release PR (from `dev` to `main`):
    - title: `r/<version> - <name>`
      - `<version>`: version of the release (must follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), e.g. `1.2.3`)
      - `<name>`: name of the release
    - description:
      - follow the template provided by GitHub
      - a link to compare the changes will be automatically generated by GitHub in the release description

## Git Commands:

- `git status`: check the status of the repository
- `git fetch origin`: fetch changes from remote
- `git checkout <branch>`: switch to an existing branch
- `git pull origin`: pull changes from remote branch
- `git rebase origin/<branch>`: rebase current branch onto remote branch, if you want to get latest changes of another branch (must be done after `git fetch origin`)
- `git add .`: stage all changes
- `git add <file>...`: stage specific file (can use glob patterns)
- `git commit -m "<commit message>"`: commit staged changes with a message
- `git push origin`: push changes to remote branch
- `git stash -u`: stash changes (to be reapplied later, for example when switching branch)
- `git stash pop`: reapply stashed changes

---

## GitHub
- ### Actions:
  - `CI`: runs on every push and PR, lints and builds the project to make sure everything is fine
  - `CD`: runs on every release from `main`, builds the Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub
- ### Secrets:
  - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Docker Hub token for pushing images (make it inside an environment named `production` to restrict access only to the main branch and version tags)
  - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Admin GitHub user token with contents write permission on that repo (make it inside an environment named `release` to restrict access only to the main branch)
- ### Variables:
  - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Docker Hub username
  - `DOCKERHUB_IMAGE`: Docker Hub image name
  - `DOCKER_BUILD_CONTEXT`: Docker build context (default: `.`)
  - `DOCKER_CONFIG_FOLDER`: Docker config folder (default: `./.docker`)
- ### Releases:
  - must have a different tag for every version (used by CD action to tag Docker image)
  - must be created from `main` branch
  - tag must be prefixed with `v` (e.g. `v1.2.3`)
  - tag must follow semantic versioning (https://semver.org/)
  - When a new version is pushed to `main`, the Docker image will be tagged with:
    - the full version (e.g. `v1.2.3`)
    - the major and minor version (e.g. `v1.2`)
    - the major version (e.g. `v1`)
    - the `latest` tag (always points to the latest version)
